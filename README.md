## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Blood, sweat, and tea ☕

### What I learned

-   **Figma Proficiency:** Acquired foundational skills in working directly with **Figma** designs for accurate front-end implementation. (The initiation into this tool was driven by troubleshooting Amd Mesa/Vulcan-related issues.)
-   **Advanced Tailwind Implementation:** Achieved a more nuanced and deeper understanding of the **Tailwind CSS (v4+)** architecture and utility-first approach in practice.

### Continued development

- **Goal:** Achieve greater **fluency and mastery** with Tailwind CSS utilities, aiming for the ability to write code quickly and instinctively without constant reference to documentation.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli) - amazing docs :3
- [Tailwind v4 cheat-sheet](https://tailwindcss.504b.cc/?ref=dailydev) - Fast Tailwind utility classes search <3
